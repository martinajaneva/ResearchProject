First, the neglect of the object (columns 1-2), may\nbe attributed to the model\u2019s limited ability to foreground limited subjects. Second, the excessive\nmanipulation of the object embedding leads to out-of-distribution (columns 3-4). An interesting\nobservation is that Magnet sometimes generates images with correct concepts, but incorrect positional\nrelations (columns 5-6). We suspect that the color layout has been determined in the early stage. In\nthis case, Magnet maps the object to the position of the attribute in the image, rather than blending\nthe attribute with the object. Magnet inherits the well-known issue of T2I models, presenting merged\nobjects (columns 7-8). Finally, it is still challenging to generate an unnatural concept when the object\nhas a strong attribute bias (columns 9-10).\n22",

        "target": "In this paper, we explore a novel GRAMA task for learning-free GNN reuse. The child model from\nGRAMA is expected to functionally merge knowledge from pre-trained parent models. Uniquely,\nGRAMA establishes the \ufb01rst paradigm in GNN reuse that operates entirely without re-training or \ufb01ne-\ntuning, while also eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. To this end, we start by developing two\nvanilla GRAMA approaches, which reveal speci\ufb01c challenges inherent to GRAMA. These challenges\nmotivate us to develop a DuMCC framework for topology-aware model reuse, leveraging a parent\nmessage coordination scheme followed by child message calibration. Experiments on node- and\ngraph-level tasks across various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for\nannotation-free knowledge transfer without additional learning.\nDespite its strengths, the proposed DuMCC is primarily designed for homogeneous GRAMA, as\ndiscussed in Sect. 3. Currently, the framework does not support cross-architecture heterogeneous\nGRAMA, where parent models have different architectures, such as a combination of GCN and\nGraphSAGE. Additionally, it does not handle scenarios where parent models address tasks at differ-\nent levels, such as node-level versus graph-level tasks\u2014another aspect of heterogeneous GRAMA.\nThese limitations primarily arise from the absence of direct correspondence between the differing\narchitectural layers of the parent models, an issue we plan to explore in our future work. We will\nalso explore the possibility of a fully data-independent GRAMA scheme and investigate broader\napplications beyond training-free model reuse, such as its use as a pre-processing step to facilitate\ngraph-based knowledge amalgamation. Further discussions on limitations and potential solutions are\nprovided in Sect. H of the appendix.\n10",
