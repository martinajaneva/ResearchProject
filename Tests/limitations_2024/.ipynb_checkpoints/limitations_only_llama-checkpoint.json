The idea is that the synthetic distribution can be approximated by a sequence of\nfunctions f1, f2,... with the property that f1(x) < f2(x) <... for all x. Hence, for any i > 1, the\ndifference f1(x) - f2(x) < 0, and hence f1(x) is a non-increasing function of x. This means that we can\nuse the sequence of functions f1(x) to generate an optimization problem. The problem is that the\nsequence f1(x) is not guaranteed to have a finite number of non-increasing subsequences. However, if the\nlimitation points can be identified, we can use these points to construct an optimization problem that\nis guaranteed to have a finite number of non-increasing subsequences.\n    ### Implementation:\n    To make the problem more tractable, we use the idea of the last non-increasing subsequence to\nidentify a set of points that approximate the limiting points of the distribution.\n    ### Results:\n    The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective. The code and the results are\navailable"
