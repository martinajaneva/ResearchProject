{"paper": "Tri-Level Navigator LLM-Empowered Tri-Level Learning for Time Series OOD Generalization", "generated": "- The proposed method is based on a single dataset, which may not be suitable for other datasets.  \n- The method is limited to large language models (LLMs) and does not account for other data types, such as large language model (LLM) or large language data (LLMA).  - The current method is not suitable for all datasets, which could affect its applicability to other types of data types."}
{"paper": "FinBen A Holistic Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models", "generated": "- FinBen is primarily designed for financial tasks, with future research to explore other financial tasks and datasets.\n- The benchmark is limited to financial tasks like financial planning and risk assessment, which may limit its applicability to other financial domains.\n, Future research should focus on developing more comprehensive benchmarks to address these limitations.\n\u2013 Future work should explore developing a more comprehensive benchmark for financial risk assessment and risk evaluation.\n"}
{"paper": "Magnet We Never Know How Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Work, Until We Learn How Vision-Language Models Function", "generated": "- Magnet's ability to generate complex text-to-image (T2I) prompts is limited by its reliance on the CLIP text encoder.\n- The current approach does not address the issue of attribute bias in T2I diffusion models, which may not be fully understood by the generalizability community or the broader diffusion model community.  \n- It is not possible to fully understand how attribute bias affects the model's performance."}
{"paper": "Deep Graph Mating", "generated": "- The current approach is limited to the pre-trained GNNs and does not address the underlying computational challenges of the current approach.  \n- Future work will focus on developing a more comprehensive approach for GRAMA and other GNN architectures, including more complex and diverse datasets."}
{"paper": "Foundation Inference Models for Markov Jump Processes", "generated": "- The model's performance is limited by the size of the dataset, which may limit its applicability to other datasets.  \n- It may not be suitable for all datasets, such as those with sparse or noisy observations, due to the large number of available datasets, and may not fully capture the full range of MJPs. \n\u2013 The model is limited to the subset of the target dataset, and is not suitable for other datasets with sparse and noisy observations."}
