{"paper": "FinBen A Holistic Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models", "generated": "- The benchmark is limited to financial tasks, which may limit its applicability to other fields.\n- The evaluation is limited by the limited dataset size and dataset diversity, limiting its ability to assess the full range of financial LLMs.\n\n- FinBen's evaluation is primarily focused on financial tasks and does not include other fields like healthcare, healthcare-related, or legal research.\n \n- Future work could explore expanding FinBen to include other financial domains, such as healthcare, education, and legal research, to enhance its applicable scope.\n"}
{"paper": "Magnet We Never Know How Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Work, Until We Learn How Vision-Language Models Function", "generated": "- The current approach is limited to text embeddings, which may not fully capture the complexity of complex text embedding scenarios.\n- The approach is not suitable for generating images with multiple attributes and objects, especially when the embedding is complex.\n\n- It may not capture all possible attributes, especially in complex text-to-image diffusion models.\n \n- Future research could explore the use of Magnet to generate more complex and diverse images.\n"}
{"paper": "Deep Graph Mating", "generated": "- The proposed DuMCC framework is designed to enhance the performance of GNN reuse without requiring re-training or fine-tuning.\n- The current approach does not address the complexity of parameter interpolation in GNNs, which is a key challenge.\n\n- Future work will focus on developing a more comprehensive approach to address these challenges."}
{"paper": "Foundation Inference Models for Markov Jump Processes", "generated": "- The method assumes that the target MJP is a discrete discrete state space, which may not be the case in certain cases.\n- The model is trained on a synthetic dataset with a large number of discrete discrete states, which is not feasible in real-world applications.\n\n- It assumes that all discrete state spaces are bounded, which could be violated by the use of a non-convex distribution.\n"}
