{"paper": "Tri-Level Navigator LLM-Empowered Tri-Level Learning for Time Series OOD Generalization", "generated": "- The proposed method is based on a simple, fixed-point optimization algorithm, which may not be suitable for all distributions, especially for large language models (LLMs).  \n- The method is limited to time series and may not generalize well to other distributions, such as other types of data.   ?????-- The approach is limited by the complexity of the optimization problem, which is not fully understood by the theoretical framework. \n\n- Future work should focus on developing a more comprehensive and comprehensive approach to generalizing the method to other distribution types.

{"paper": "Foundation Inference Models for Markov Jump Processes", "generated": "- The method assumes that the observed data is a finite set of discrete state spaces, which may not hold for all possible discrete state space processes.  \n- The model assumes that all observed data are discrete, but this assumption may not be true for all discrete state processes.\n- It assumes that each discrete state is a discrete set, which is not true for most discrete state systems. \n\n- This assumption is not valid for all types of discrete states, as the observed state space may be different from the observed one.
