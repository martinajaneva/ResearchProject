        "year": 2021,
        "limitations": "- Diffusion models are currently slower than GANs at sampling due to multiple denoising steps, with each forward pass taking 5\u201320 times longer because they are larger models.\n- Approaches like Luhman and Luhman\u2019s single-step distillation of DDIM sampling show promise for closing the speed gap, but these single-step samples are not yet as competitive as GANs.\n- Unlike GANs, flows, and VAEs, diffusion models do not learn explicit latent representations, making it unclear how meaningful their implicit latent spaces are for tasks like representation learning or image editing.\n- The use of classifier guidance indicates that diffusion models can be conditioned using gradients from classifiers, such as text-to-image models with noisy CLIP, but this approach is currently limited to labeled datasets.\n- Future work could extend classifier guidance to unlabeled data by clustering or training discriminative models, enabling the leverage of large unlabeled datasets for pre-training more powerful diffusion models.\n- Developing methods to improve sampling speed without sacrificing image quality remains a key area for future research."

        "year": 2021,
        "limitations": "- Diffusion models are currently slower than GANs at sampling due to multiple denoising steps, with each forward pass taking 5\u201320 times longer because they are larger models.\n- Approaches like Luhman and Luhman\u2019s single-step distillation of DDIM sampling show promise for closing the speed gap, but these single-step samples are not yet as competitive as GANs.\n- Unlike GANs, flows, and VAEs, diffusion models do not learn explicit latent representations, making it unclear how meaningful their implicit latent spaces are for tasks like representation learning or image editing.\n- The use of classifier guidance indicates that diffusion models can be conditioned using gradients from classifiers, such as text-to-image models with noisy CLIP, but this approach is currently limited to labeled datasets.\n- Future work could extend classifier guidance to unlabeled data by clustering or training discriminative models, enabling the leverage of large unlabeled datasets for pre-training more powerful diffusion models.\n- Developing methods to improve sampling speed without sacrificing image quality remains a key area for future research."
